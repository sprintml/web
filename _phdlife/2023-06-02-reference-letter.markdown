You wrote your statement of purpose. Now, you need reference letters. The main purpose is to provide the person who wants to hire you with an impression of your work through the perspective of people you have worked with in the past. 

Ask your previous advisors, managers, mentors, or even professors who taught the courses where you performed very well and whose content is aligned with your future topics of interest. If you have already written a thesis (Bachelor or Master), you should also definitely ask your advisor because they probably had enough interactions with you to know you well enough for such a letter.

Reaching out to these people might be challenging and you might feel hesitant to do it because you know that it will cause them some overhead. What you can do to feel more confident reaching out and to reduce your reference letter-writer , you can realso help them with that. Prepare a document where you’d list the position that you’re applying for, all your achievements, especially related to the person whom you asked for the letter. Mention what your involvement in a given project was. What were your main contributions? How the project differed from prior work? How long did you work on the project? This will be a good starting point for your letter writer and ultimately, it will make the letter much stronger.
