The paper is more than a research idea and experiments, unfortunately. You also have to give talks about your research, publish your code, paper, and promote your work. In this post, we focus on the bread-and-butter of ML researchers, namely, on "how to submit your paper to ArXiv?". 

First of all, we assume that you have your paper in the LaTex format on overleaf. Simply, download your files as a zip file and then use the cleaning tool to remove all the comments. This is an important step since you might not want to publish the work on ArXiv that someone else can get the source of and see all your comments, previous versions of your paragraphs, etc. If this is not desirable, at the end, this is not intended to be read, then use the [arxiv-latex-cleaner tool](https://github.com/google-research/arxiv-latex-cleaner). Our favorite command is simply arxiv-latex-cleaner --keep_bib folder_from_overleaf. Then, copy to a different location and rename the produced folder to the original name (to preserve the references from latex).
