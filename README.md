# SprintML Website

This is the academic website of the SprintML lab at CISPA.

## About the Website
The template for the website was forked and adapted from the [Allan Lab](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab/tree/gh-pages).
The underlying frameworks are Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. 
We additionally added the display of our bibliography from a bibtex file based on [Jekyll-Scholar](https://github.com/inukshuk/jekyll-scholar).


## Acknowledgements
Finally, we would like to acknowledge other academic pages that inspired the design of our website:
- We took the idea of highlighting the authors who are current or past members for the lab from the [CleverHans Lab](https://cleverhans-lab.github.io/) .
- We were inspired by the design of the "Team" page by the [Kwiat Lab](https://github.com/KwiatLab/group-website-jekyll?ref=jekyll-themes.com) and integrated their for loop in our code to iterate over and display our lab members.
- We took the code to display the calendar icon next to the publication data of blogposts on the overview pages from [academicpages](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io). The icon itself stems from the [Font-Awesome](https://github.com/FortAwesome/Font-Awesome) package.
