# SprintML Website

This is the academic website of the SprintML lab at CISPA.

The template for the website was forked and adapted from the [Allan Lab](https://github.com/mpa139/allanlab/tree/gh-pages).
The underlying frameworks are Jekyll and some Bootstrap, Bootwatch. 

Please reach out to [Adam Dziedzic](https://adam-dziedzic.com/) and [Franziska Boenisch](https://franziska-boenisch.de/) for comments or concerns.
